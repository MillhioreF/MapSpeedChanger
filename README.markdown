Map Speed Changer v1.32
by MillhioreF


~~~*~* HOW TO USE *~*~~~

0. Make sure you have an mp3 of the song speed you want, this program doesn't make one for you!
1. Extract the contents of this zip file into any folder.
2. Drag the .osu file that you want to change the speed of into the same folder (not the jar folder)
3. Run the .bat file and follow the instructions on screen.
4. Drag the new .osu file back into the folder you got it from and refresh the song list.


~~~*~* USAGE TIPS *~*~~~

- Odds are you'll have to edit the offset of the map this program creates; Audacity adds a few ms when it encodes an mp3, so that'll throw off the timing.

- The .osu filename MAY be weird when you drop it into the song folder - this fixes itself after saving it in the editor, which I hope you do due to the point above.

- Source code is public and can be found at https://github.com/MillhioreF/MapSpeedChanger/ . Be warned that the code is absolute shit and probably is hardly readable - feel free to ask me what the hell some of my code is doing.

- Bugs, questions and comments should be posted in this tool's thread: http://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/114765/


Enjoy!

~~~*~* KNOWN ISSUES *~*~~~
